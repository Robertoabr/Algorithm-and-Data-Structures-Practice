I have created a local database called sqlpractice

With 4 tables: Customer, dogwalker, appt-details and CustomerXappt

Table structure is at
https://api.genmymodel.com/projects/_DyCPcOOiEemtQJ5uHCArog/diagrams/_DyCPcuOiEemtQJ5uHCArog/svg

to connect to database enter: psql [option] [dbname[username]]
to see the relations for that database enter: \dt

select * from "OwnershipDocument". You need quotes because of the uppercase characters.
